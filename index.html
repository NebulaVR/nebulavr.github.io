                <p> Nebula is a programming language intended for expression. Its use of multidimensional logical constructs to perform actions between nodes likens it to a Turing Machine. These nodes are powerful; rather than simply holding data
                    and linking to other structures, they can trigger actions on the global environment and ultimately cause the execution of functions whose return values may ripple back to the original node. Inspirations for the project include
                    JavaScript, Python, Go, and Haskell. Many of the constructs in Nebula's standard library as well as its primitive structures and types are derived from these languages. Though it borrows some ideas from some of these well-known
                    programming languages, Nebula also offers a new programming paradigm, "spatial programming", an intuitive and fresh way to work with scoping.

                <p>Dynamic: Dynamically typed by default, but optional static typing can be enforced
                    Asynchronous: Designed for asynchronous programming; can wait for events while retaining state
                    Functional: The eager loading of parameters allows for the power of a functional language but also the flexibility of an imperative language
                    Object Oriented: Editable properties can be attached to every construct in the language, and these objects can be mutable or immutable
                    Spatially Scoped: Spatial programming is a brand new way of determining the realms within which variables and objects exist
